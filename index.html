          There is no shortcut in life. And in programming world, there isn't
          any at all. You've got to pay your dues and only then you will reach
          where you want to go. That's what I believe and try to make sure to
          follow with every project of mine. I don't try to find easy way out
          without providing the highest quality product or service to my
          employeers
